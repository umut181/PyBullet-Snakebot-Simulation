# MIT MAKER: PyBullet-Snakebot-Simulation
- PROJECT FOR MIT MAKER PORTFOLIO 

A simulation pipeline developed by Umut Cakar using PyBullet/Bullet Physics Engine to analyze the performance of modular snake robots on virtual post-earthquake disaster zones. Features "lateral undulation" and "sidewinding" locomotion gaits, and "rubble" and "ramp" terrains.

Guide:
Select the locomotion gait and terrain type. 
Use manual steering to follow the task trajectory and complete the obstacle course. 
Collect and process performance data.
